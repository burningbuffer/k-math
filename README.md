# MAT

This project begin as a small SIMD math library intended for rotations, and will be following as a SIMD generalist graphics math library.

## SIMD

SIMD (Simple Instruction Multiple Data) is the resource in microprocessors that permit optimizations with multiple data operations in one machine instruction and it comes as different instruction sets like MMX, SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions).

This library uses SSE with 128 bits registers.
